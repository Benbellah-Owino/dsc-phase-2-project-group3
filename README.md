## Business Problem
Your company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Objectives
* 1. **Identify high-performing movie genres and themes.** Analyze the top 5 years of global box office data to determine which genres and themes generate the highest average revenue and audience ratings.
* 2. **Analyze audience and market trends.** Track audience preferences and regional performance trends over the past 5–10 years to identify growing market segments.
* 3. **Evaluate key success factors influencing box office performance.** Quantify how production and marketing factors (budget, runtime, release month, star power, etc.) affect movie profitability.
* 4. **Provide actionable recommendations for content strategy.** Translate data findings into a business strategy that directs the company’s new studio toward commercially viable movie projects.
